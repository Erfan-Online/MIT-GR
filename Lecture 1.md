We start the course by looking at Special Relativity in a form that emphasizes its geometric nature.

## Definitions

### Spacetime
Spacetime is a _manifold_ of _events_ that is endowed with a _metric_.

### Manifold
GPT: Manifold is a topological space that is locally Euclidean. (i.e. it looks like a Euclidean space when zoomed in)
Prof: A set of points with well-understood connectedness properties.

What we mean is that we're going to be talking about manifolds of space and time. So far it means that we have a bunch of events at some place A and some time T, and a bunch of events at some place B at time T', and the manifold is a notion of how I connect these two events.

More rigorous definition can be found in Carroll's book. (pp 54-62)

## Event
When and where something happens. (which will be labelled with coordinates, but the event itself will exist independent of these labels)

## Metric
A notion of distance between events in a manifold. \
Without this, a manifold has no notion of distance encoded in it.

[You can have a manifold without any notion of a metric attached to it. \
Joke: If you don't know what the difference is between a manifold with and without a metric, feel free to drink coffee out of a donut. \
Because they're topologically equivalent, but their geometry, which is encoded in the metric, which tells me how the different points on that manifold are arranged, are rather different.]

Later in the corse, what we're going to find is that part of Einstein's genius is that it turns out that this notion of the metric ends up encoding gravity.

## Special Relativity

Simplest theory of spacetime, corresponds to general relativity in the no-gravity limit.

To get into this, we need to introduce a key notion.
